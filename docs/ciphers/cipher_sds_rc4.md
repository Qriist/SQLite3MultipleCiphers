## <a name="cipher_rc4"/> System.Data.SQLite: RC4

This cipher is included with [System.Data.SQLite](https://system.data.sqlite.org), an ADO.NET provider for SQLite. It provides a 128 bit RC4 encryption. This encryption scheme had been added to **wxSQLite3** in early 2020 to allow cross-platform access to databases created with _System.Data.SQLite_ based applications. **SQLite3 Multiple Ciphers** continues to support this cipher for compatibility reasons only.

The encryption key is derived from the passphrase using an **_SHA1_** hash function.

The cipher does not use a _Hash Message Authentication Code_ (HMAC), and requires therefore no reserved bytes per database page.

The following table lists all parameters related to this cipher that can be set before activating database encryption.

| Parameter | Default | Min | Max | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `legacy` | 1 | 1 | 1 | Boolean flag whether the legacy mode should be used |
| `legacy_page_size` | 0 | 0 | 65536 | Page size to use in legacy mode, 0 = default SQLite page size |

**Notes**
{: .label .label-red .ml-0 .mb-1 .mt-2 }
- Currently only the [_legacy_ mode]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/ciphers/cipher_legacy_mode.md %}) is implemented; it is not intended to implement a _non-legacy_ mode in the future, because RC4 encryption has known weaknesses (for example, the use of RC4 in TLS was prohibited by RFC 7465 published in February 2015).
- **The use of this cipher scheme for new applications is strongly discouraged.**
- Only _page size_ values corresponding to a power of 2 (i.e. 0, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536) are allowed.
